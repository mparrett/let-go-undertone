// A one-shot has to be heard over the bed it plays against, which is a
// question about WHERE its energy sits, not how loud it is. The bed's drone
// and air track are lowpassed at 280-300 Hz, so everything below that is the
// bed's; and a phone speaker reproduces almost nothing under ~200 Hz, so
// energy spent there is spent twice over on nobody. The band above 1200 Hz is
// the one both facts leave free.
//
// Measured against the depth-2 bed, the footstep's first shape put 81% of its
// peak energy below 120 Hz (0.8 dB under the drone) and 2% above 1200 Hz
// (2.9 dB under). It was reported as inaudible in play, which is what sent
// this measurement looking. See the footstep patch in sfx.go.

// bandSplit is the same four-way split the VU meter uses (120/350/1200 Hz).
